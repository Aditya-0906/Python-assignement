Which function is used to open a file? What are the different modes of opening a file? Explain each mode\nof file opening.\n\nAns1. The function used to open a file in python is open(\"file_path\",\"open_mode\"). The parametres passed to this function are file name and open mode.\nThe different modes for opening a file are as follows:\n\n1. 'f'--> open for reading.\n2. 'w'--> open for writing, truncating for the file first.\n3. 'x'--> create a new file and open it for writing.\n4. 'a'--> oprn for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists.\n5. 'b'--> binary mode\n6. 't'--> text mode(default)\n7.

Why is it important to close a file?\nAns2. In python close() function is used to close the file and release the memory occupied by the file variable. It is important to close a file \nbecause of following reasons:\n\n1. When we open a file, the operating system allocates resources to manage the file access. Closing the file ensures that these resources are \nreleased and made available for other processes.\n2. When we write data to a file, the data is often first buffered in memory. The close() function ensures that all the data in the buffer \nis properly written to the file before closing it.\n3.

Python provides a more efficient and cleaner way to manage files using the with statement.
