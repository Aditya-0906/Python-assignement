What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\nAns1. Multithreading in Python is a concurrent execution technique that allows multiple threads (smaller units of a process) to run\nsimultaneously within a single process. Each thread runs independently, performing a specific task, but they share the same memory \nspace. \n\nThe multithreading is used in python because:\n1.

Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n\nAns6. Deadlock: A deadlock is a situation in concurrent programming where two or more threads (or processes) are blocked forever, \nwaiting for each other to release resources that they need to continue their execution. This leads to a situation where no thread \ncan proceed, effectively freezing the program or system.\n\nHow Deadlock Occurs:\nDeadlock typically occurs when the following four conditions are met (often referred to as the Coffman conditions):\n\nMutual Exclusion: Only one thread can access a resource at a time. If one thread holds a resource, others must wait for it to \nbe released.\n\nHold and Wait: A thread that holds at least one resource is waiting for additional resources that are currently held by other threads.\n\nNo Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from threads holding them. They must be released voluntarily.\n\nCircular Wait: A set of threads are waiting for resources held by the next thread in a circular chain. For example, Thread A is \nwaiting for a resource held by Thread B, and Thread B is waiting for a resource held by Thread A.","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Race condition: A race condition occurs when multiple threads or processes attempt to read and write shared data at the same time, \nleading to unpredictable behavior.
